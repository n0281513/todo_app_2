        <h2>Challenge: Figure out how to delete an item!</h2><br>
        <h3>***Notes on deleting to todo items***</h3>
        1. you need a unique id for each item <br>
        2. you need a delete button that can be accessed individually in JS<br>
        3. you can use the id for each item to give its button a unique id<br>
        4. you can grab the id for the todo that is to be deletes using JS<br>
        5. remember, you can create HTML using the string - including ids<br>
        6. to remove an element from an array. use the fuction slice()<br>
        7. buttons will need event listners. those are to be created at the time you dynamically creat the buttons
